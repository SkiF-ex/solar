Just use comand `npm i`

Then you can start project with comand - `npm run start`

### Feedback

The first difficulty was with the API. I couldn't get the data until I disabled adblock.

You can notice the index.js file in each component. This is done to shorten the import of any components.

I also added the utility 'classnames' to work better with classes when several classes need to be specified.

The rest can be considered routine, as there were no difficulties.
